This Repository contains the datasets of images used to create the customized text-to-image generators to recreate Sebastiano Serlio's works presented in the paper: 

"Architectural Drawing with Artificial Intelligence: Stable Diffusion Learns from Sebastiano Serlio"

Three datasets are included:

1) Doorways
2) Facades (Turrets)
3) Facades (Horizontal)

that were used for the three models described in the paper.

The fine-tuned models were trained in Leonardo AI with the following settings:

- Model: Stable Diffusion v2
- Training resolution: 768x768
- Category: Buildings
- Strength: Medium


and instance prompts:

1) Doorways: "A door"
2) Facades (Turrets): "A building facade" 
3) Facades (Horizontal): "A building facade"
